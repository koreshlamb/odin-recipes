    <h2>You love to see the cheese pull</h2>
    <p>My mom liked to make the Hamburger HelperÂ® version of this recipe. When I moved to another state, I could not find it, so I came up with this. Memories of home. My hubby likes for me to spice this up sometimes, so I will use a 14-ounce can of tomatoes and green chiles in it or just use a Mexican-style cornbread mix sometimes.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>

      <li>1 small onion</li>
      <li>2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>2 (15 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes</li>
